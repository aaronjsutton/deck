# :spades: :diamonds: Deck :hearts: :clubs:

Deck is a library that models and manipulates a
simulated deck of cards.  

# Status

Deck is currently _in early development_. **Stay tuned!**

# Testing

Deck uses the testing framework [µnit](https://nemequ.github.io/munit/).
As µnit is part of the repository, running the tests is very simple.

First, ensure submodules are up-to-date with:
```
git submodule update --init
```

Then, the tests can be invoked from `make` using:
```
make test
```

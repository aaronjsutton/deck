# Contribution Guide

If you wish to fix a bug or add a feature to Deck, do so by:

1. Opening an issue if one is not already open. 
2. Forking the repository, and creating a new branch for your feature or fix. 
3. Committing your changes and submit a PR against `develop`. 

## Documentation Generation

When you submit a PR and it is merged, documentation is automatically generated and updated by CI.

For development purposes, docs can be generated by running the `generate-docs` 
script located in `/scripts`.
You must have [Doxygen](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen) installed.

Thank you for helping to improve Deck.
